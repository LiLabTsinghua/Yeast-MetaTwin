<!-- Describe your project in brief -->
**Feel free to contact me via email at yuhanid147@gmail.com if you encounter any issues or have any questions.**

**Introduction of UniKP.**

Prediction of enzyme kinetic parameters is essential for designing and optimizing enzymes for various biotechnological and industrial applications, but the limited performance of current prediction tools on diverse tasks hinders their practical applications. Here, we introduce UniKP, a unified framework based on pretrained language models for the prediction of enzyme kinetic parameters, including enzyme turnover number (*k*<sub>cat</sub>), Michaelis constant (*K*<sub>m</sub>), and catalytic efficiency (*k*<sub>cat</sub> / *K*<sub>m</sub>), from protein sequences and substrate structures. A two-layer framework derived from UniKP (EF-UniKP) has also been proposed to allow robust *k*<sub>cat</sub> prediction in considering environmental factors, including pH and temperature. In addition, four representative re-weighting methods are systematically explored to successfully reduce the prediction error in high-value prediction tasks. We have demonstrated the application of UniKP and EF-UniKP in several enzyme discovery and directed evolution tasks, leading to the identification of new enzymes and enzyme mutants with higher activity. UniKP is a valuable tool for deciphering the mechanisms of enzyme kinetics and enables novel insights into enzyme engineering and their industrial applications.

**Here is the framework of UniKP.**

# Table of contents

<!-- After you have introduced your project, it is a good idea to add a **Table of contents** or **TOC** as **cool** people say it. This would make it easier for people to navigate through your README and find exactly what they are looking for.

Here is a sample TOC(*wow! such cool!*) that is actually the TOC for this README. -->

# Prerequisites
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

Notice:
- You need download pretrained protein language modoel *ProtT5-XL-UniRef50* to generate enzyme representation, the link is provided on [ProtT5-XL-U50](https://zenodo.org/records/4644188).
- You also need download model *UniKP* for ***k*<sub>cat</sub>, *K*<sub>m</sub>** and ***k*<sub>cat</sub> / *K*<sub>m</sub>** to predict corresponding kinetic parameters, the link is provided on [UniKP_model](https://huggingface.co/HanselYu/UniKP/tree/main).

**Place these two downloaded models in the UniKP directory.**

- We have included pretrained molecular language modoel *SMILES Transformer* in this repository to generate substrate representation, the link is also provided on [SMILES Transformer](https://github.com/DSPsleeporg/smiles-transformer).

<!-- *You might have noticed the **Back to top** button(if not, please notice, it's right there!). This is a good idea because it makes your README **easy to navigate.*** 

The first one should be how to install(how to generally use your project or set-up for editing in their machine).

This should give the users a concrete idea with instructions on how they can use your project repo with all the steps.

Following this steps, **they should be able to run this in their device.**

A method I use is after completing the README, I go through the instructions from scratch and check if it is working. -->

<!-- Here is a sample instruction:

To use this project, first clone the repo on your device using the command below:

```git init```

```git clone https://github.com/navendu-pottekkat/nsfw-filter.git``` -->

  - (1). Download the UniKP package
  
         git clone https://github.com/Luo-SynBioLab/UniKP
  
  - (2). Create and activate enviroment
  
         conda create -n Uni_test python=3.7

<!-- This is optional and it is used to give the user info on how to use the project after installation. This could be added in the Installation section also. -->

# Development
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

<!-- This is the place where you give instructions to developers on how to modify the code.

You could give **instructions in depth** of **how the code works** and how everything is put together.

You could also give specific instructions to how they can setup their development environment.

Ideally, you should keep the README simple. If you need to add more complex explanations, use a wiki. Check out [this wiki](https://github.com/navendu-pottekkat/nsfw-filter/wiki) for inspiration. -->

### Adding new features or fixing bugs
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

<!-- This is to give people an idea how they can raise issues or feature requests in your projects. 

You could also give guidelines for submitting and issue or a pull request to your project.

Personally and by standard, you should use a [issue template](https://github.com/navendu-pottekkat/nsfw-filter/blob/master/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) and a [pull request template](https://github.com/navendu-pottekkat/nsfw-filter/blob/master/PULL_REQ_TEMPLATE.md)(click for examples) so that when a user opens a new issue they could easily format it as per your project guidelines.

You could also add contact details for people to get in touch with you regarding your project. -->
