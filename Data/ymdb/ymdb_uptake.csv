YMDB02301,Benzoic acid,OC(=O)C1=CC=CC=C1,"Benzoic acid, C6H5COOH, is a colourless crystalline solid and the simplest aromatic carboxylic acid. Benzoic acid occurs naturally free and bound as benzoic acid esters in many plant and animal species. Appreciable amounts have been found in most berries (around 0.05%). Cranberries contain as much as 300-1300 mg free benzoic acid per kg fruit. Benzoic acid is a fungistatic compound that is widely used as a food preservative. Benzoic acid is a byproduct of phenylalanine metabolism in bacteria. It is also produced when gut bacteria process polyphenols (from ingested fruits or beverages)",WPYMKLBDIGXBTP

YMDB01774,Phenyllactic acid,CC(O)(C(O)=O)C1=CC=CC=C1,"Phenyllactic acid (PLA) is an antifungal metabolite produced by lactic acid bacteria (LAB). Lactic acid bacteria are naturally associated with many foods or their raw ingredients and are popularly used in food fermentation to enhance the sensory, aromatic, and textural properties of food.
